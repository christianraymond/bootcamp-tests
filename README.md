# bootcamp-tests

In this Repo, I will be using Mocha and Chai to test the rest of the functions created.
What is Mcha?: Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser,
making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting,
while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases

What is Chai? :

Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired
with any javascript testing framework. 
You might have heard that Chai has several interfaces, such as TDD (Test Drive Development)
and the one that I will be using in this Repo is, BDD which stands for Behaviour Drive Development.
